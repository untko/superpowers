# Model Selection

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role to conserve cost and increase speed.

**Always specify the model explicitly when dispatching a subagent.** An omitted model inherits your session's model — often the most capable and most expensive — which silently defeats this entire section.

## By Role

**Mechanical implementation tasks** (isolated functions, clear specs, 1-2 files): use a fast, cheap model. Most implementation tasks are mechanical when the plan is well-specified.

**Integration and judgment tasks** (multi-file coordination, pattern matching, debugging): use a standard model.

**Architecture and design tasks**: use the most capable available model. The final whole-branch review is one of these — dispatch it on the most capable available model, not the session default.

**Review tasks**: choose the model with the same judgment, scaled to the diff's size, complexity, and risk. A small mechanical diff does not need the most capable model; a subtle concurrency change does. Scoped re-reviews of small fix diffs take a cheap-to-mid tier.

**Fix-loop escalation (rounds 4-5)**: use a model at least one tier above the implementer that got stuck.

## Turn Count Beats Token Price

Wall-clock and context cost scale with how many turns a subagent takes, and the cheapest models routinely take 2-3× the turns on multi-step work — costing more overall.

- Use a mid-tier model as the floor for reviewers and for implementers working from prose descriptions.
- When the task's plan text contains the complete code to write, the implementation is transcription plus testing: use the cheapest tier for that implementer.
- Single-file mechanical fixes also take the cheapest tier.

## Task Complexity Signals (implementation tasks)

- Touches 1-2 files with a complete spec → cheap model
- Touches multiple files with integration concerns → standard model
- Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding → most capable model
